## Asynchronous execution
Note that we use Python's [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) framework[^2] to run the bot and web server asynchronously in the same process, which means we only have to execute `bot.py` to run both.
This allows us to share data between the bot and web server (see [Shared data models](#shared-data-models) below).

We achieve this by registering the Telegram bot's initialization methods in the `startup()` method in `bot.py`, which is decorated with `@webapp.before_serving` and thus called before the web server is started.
The web server itself is run using `webapp.run_task()`.
Similarly, when the web server is shutdown (i.e., when the process is terminated), the Telegram bot is stopped in the `shutdown()` method, which is decorated with `@webapp.after_serving`.
The Updater in `python-telegram-bot` may time out, which is why it takes up to 5 seconds (the default timeout) for the process to terminate (we also have to ignore the `TimedOut` exception in the shutdown handler).

[^2]: Specifically, we use the [`Quart`](https://palletsprojects.com/p/quart/) web framework, and the [`python-telegram-bot`](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) library, both of which are built on top of `asyncio`.

## Shared data models
The [`shared.py`](src/shared.py) file contains the shared data models used by both the bot and the web server.
Specifically, the following data models are defined:
- [`Event`](src/shared.py#L36): Represents a single event (i.e., a poll). Apart from the event ID and creation time, it contains the event's title, description, available days, and anonymity/notification settings, along with a list of `EventVote`s.
    - Methods for counting (`num_votes`) or returning (`day_votes`) the number of votes for a given day and given type of vote (yes/no/maybe) are also defined.
    - The `best_days` method returns a list of the "most suitable" days for the event.
      Most suitable, in this case, means the days with the largest number of *yes* votes.
      If there are multiple such days, we choose from these the ones with the largest number of *maybe* votes.
      If there are no days with at least one *yes* vote, we return an empty list.
- [`EventVote`](src/shared.py#L121): Represents a user's vote on a poll. It consists of the user's ID and name[^1], a dictionary mapping days to the type of vote (yes/no/maybe), and the time at which the vote was cast.
- [`SharedContext`](src/shared.py#L22): Represents the shared context between the bot and the web server. It contains the `telegram_app` on which the bot runs and the passed command line arguments in `args`.

[^1]: The user's name is only stored if the poll is not anonymous. Otherwise, it is set to an empty string.

## Implementation details

### Telegram bot
The Telegram bot has been implemented using the [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) library â€“ read their excellent [documentation](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/v20.6/) to learn more.

Persistence has also been implemented using the library's built-in [pickling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) functionality:
We store all polls in the `bot_data['events']` dictionary, which maps event IDs to `Event` objects.
The web server accesses this dictionary through the `telegram_app.bot_data` attribute available on the `SharedContext` object.

### Web server
The web server has been implemented using the [Quart](https://palletsprojects.com/p/quart/) web framework, which has been chosen due to its similarity to Flask (which I am more familiar with) and its built-in support for asynchronous execution.

In the `webapp_server.py` file, we define the following routes:
- `/`: The index page, which just displays a short message. May be useful for testing whether the web server is running correctly.
- `/create`: The page for creating a new poll. It contains a form for entering the poll's title, description, and available days, along with a checkbox for making the poll anonymous and a checkbox for enabling notifications.
- `/vote`: The page for voting in a poll. The poll ID is passed via the URL parameter `tgWebAppStartParam`, which Telegram appends automatically if the `t.me` link is passed the `startapp` URL parameter. The page contains a form for selecting "Yes/No/Maybe" for each available day.
- `/results`: The page for viewing the results of a poll. The poll ID is passed either via the URL parameter `poll_id` or via `tgWebAppStartParam`, which Telegram appends automatically if the `t.me` link is passed the `startapp` URL parameter. The page contains a table with the number of yes/no/maybe votes for each day, listing what each user voted (if the poll is not anonymous), along with a button for deleting the poll if the user is the creator of the poll.
- `/polls`: The API endpoint which the JavaScript files use. Note that we [validate the `initData`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app) before doing anything else, to make sure nothing weird is going on. We differentiate on the HTTP method used:
    - `POST`: This creates a new poll based on the JSON included in the request body.
    - `PATCH`: This casts a vote in a poll based on the JSON included in the request body. Alternatively, if a vote for this user on this poll already exists, it is overwritten.
    - `GET`: This returns the results link and the JSON-encoded vote for the user and poll specified in the URL parameters.
    - `DELETE`: This deletes the poll specified in the JSON included in the request body.

An additional note on the validation: 
The data is also rejected if the sent data is more than 60 minutes old.
This is to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker could send the same data multiple times to the server.
The relatively high number of 60 minutes was chosen just in case the user spends a long time entering some poll data, we wouldn't want to reject it just because it took them that long.

### Web pages

#### HTML
We use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates for the web pages, which are located in the [`templates/`](templates/) directory.

On the results page, we pass the result data from the server to the client via template parameters, which on the one hand construct the page to contain the votes for each day, and on the other hand set some hidden `<input>` fields which the JavaScript files can then access.
For example, the `poll.id` is passed this way so that the JavaScript files can create a shareable link to the results page.
Since any user that has the link to the results page can see the results, we don't need to validate the client in any way here before showing the data.

This is different on the voting page: Polls can be anonymous, which means that instead of passing the data via template parameters to the client, we do it via the API endpoint.
Otherwise, an attacker may send a forged request containing the user's ID and name, and the server would happily accept it (since it does not have access to the `initData` at the point the template is rendered).
This way, the server can validate the client before sending the private votes of the user.

Requests in which any data is modified (poll creation/deletion and voting) are always validated.

#### CSS
We use [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the web pages, which is included in the [`base.html`](templates/base.html) template.
In the `style.css` file, we make liberal use of the CSS variables Telegram passes to the web app (such as `--tg-theme-bg-color`), so that the theme of the web app matches the theme of the Telegram app.
Additionally, there are a lot of smaller modifications to the default Bootstrap styles, which are mostly there to make the app look as close as possible to the Telegram app.

#### JavaScript
The JavaScript files are split into three files, one for each page.
Additionally, in `common.js` we define some common functions used by all pages.
For example, we define `replaceDateElements`, which is used to render the dates in the user's locale, and `runOnVersion`, which only runs the given callback if the user's app supports it, and runs an alternative callback otherwise.

An additional note:
On the results screen (`results.js`), we offer the user to share the results with a Telegram chat.
By default, we use `switchInlineQuery()` for this, but if it isn't available, we use the always available `openTelegramLink()` to open a link of the form `https://t.me/share/url?url=>results_url>`, which at least has a similar effect.

### Debugging
To make debugging easier, you can pass the `--debug` argument to `bot.py` to enable debug logging and enable the debug modes of both asyncio and Quart.

As an additional tip, if you pass one or more Telegram user IDs to the `--admin-ids` argument, you will be able to use the `/dump` command to dump the bot's data to the current chat (it will also be printed to the console).
Otherwise, the command will not be available.
