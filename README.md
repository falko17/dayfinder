On the results page, you can see the number of yes/no/maybe votes for each date.
If the poll is not anonymous, you can also click on these numbers to see who voted for which dates.
By clicking on "Expand all," you can see the names of all voters at once.
Clicking on a voter's name also reveals the date and time at which they voted.

### Deleting a poll
To delete a poll, open the [results page](#viewing-results) of the poll and click on "Delete poll."

### Listing your polls
To list your polls, you can either send the bot the `/polls` command, or use [inline mode](#inline-mode).
Clicking on one of your polls after having sent the `/polls` command will open the [results page](#viewing-results) of the poll.

### Inline Mode
To use the bot in inline mode, simply type `@dayfinderbot` in any chat.
You can optionally enter the name of a poll after it (e.g., `@dayfinderbot my poll`) to search for a specific poll, otherwise all of your polls will be listed.

For each poll of yours, you will get the option to send the voting link or the results to the current chat â€“ just click on the corresponding button in the list that pops open.
Alternatively, you can click on the small icon to the left of the option to open the page yourself without sending it.
